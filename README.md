# Reverse Proxy Service
This is a NGINX reverse proxy config which is used to publish subgraphs hosted by Neon EVM which are not generally open to public.

# Service Provider
We recommend utilising a third party service such as [Render](https://render.com). Graph queries often utilise mininal bandwidth therefore a free service from [Render](https://render.com) should be suitable to requirements.
